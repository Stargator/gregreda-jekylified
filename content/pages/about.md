Iâ€™m a software engineer based in Washington, DC. I have been in the professional field since 2010. I focus on supporting my team members and project by researching technical solutions, learning whatever technology/tool used, and never tearing anyone down.

I was first hired as a Junior Java Developer for a project that was around 10 years old and, unusually, still maintained by the same company. I learned a lot about the professional work environment, such as what tools are used and the common practices.
I spent a year there, before being exposed to Groovy and Grails for a few months and shuffling over to a project where I was the lead developer producing a web application for use as a widget in the Ozone Widget Framework.

Which has continued to be the path of my professional career, coming and going from projects, some I may stay for a year, while others I've only been there for a few months. There are a few tools and practices that are shared between them all. And while a lot of them have some tangential relationship with Java, I've never just been a Java developer.

I've done frontend development for what is now the majority of my career, but never with the same libraries or toolset. I'm fairly flexible, but I feel like I have an understanding of the needs for good teams.
